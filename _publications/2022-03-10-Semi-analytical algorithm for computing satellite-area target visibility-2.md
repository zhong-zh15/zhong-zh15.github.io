excerpt: 'Computing the visibility of remote sensing satellites on an area target is an important basic satellite observation mission. The calculational accuracy and efficiency are then very important for satellite imaging scheduling. This paper presents a fast, semi-analytical algorithm for predicting satellite-area target visibility. First, geometric relations are used to define the boundaries of all the area targets described by ordinary arcs with the algorithm then determining the intersections. Then, the cone characteristics and the rectangular field of view of the satellite are used with a fast judgement condition for the visibility. The visibility at each discrete time step is determined analytically with a binary search which is then used to quickly predict the time for the visible window. Numerical examples show that this method is accurate and efficient.'
