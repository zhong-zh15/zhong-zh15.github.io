excerpt: 'In this paper, the methods and results from Tsinghua University and Shanghai Institute of Satellite Engineering for the 11th Global Trajectory Optimization Competition (GTOC11) are presented. To deal with the complicated “Dyson Sphere” building problem, a three-stage procedure is conducted. First, the pre-analysis is performed to reduce search space. It is found that two-impulse maneuvers between asteroid flybys are near-optimal, the semi-major axis of the “Dyson Ring” should be better at 1.0–1.5 AU, and the larger arrival mass asteroids tend to be selected. Second, the globally optimal trajectory design problem is further divided into two sub-problems, the mothership trajectory design and the asteroid assignment to the “Dyson Ring” power stations. For the first problem, beam search is used to obtain numerous single mothership trajectories based on a pre-constructed flyby trajectory database of 3–8 asteroids. The overall trajectories and asteroids visited are obtained by selecting 10 mothership trajectories with a genetic algorithm. For the second problem, we build a database of optimal rendezvous times for all the 83,453 asteroids at different phase angles to reach power stations of different radii and phase angles, then a greedy algorithm is proposed to obtain the asteroid arrival schedule based on all the asteroids visited by motherships. Finally, local optimization of asteroid sequence and flyby epochs is conducted. The activation time adjustment in combination with indirect continuous-thrust trajectory optimization is used based on the global optimization result. In the final submission, motherships fly by 388 asteroids, and the minimum mass of twelve power stations reaches 94% of the theoretical upper bound, which is defined using the minimum-time orbital transfers with free initial and target phases.'
