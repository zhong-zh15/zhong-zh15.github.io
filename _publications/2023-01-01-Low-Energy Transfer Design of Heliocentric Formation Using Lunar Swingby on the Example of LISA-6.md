excerpt: 'Space-based gravitational wave (GW) detection at low frequencies is of great scientific significance and has received extensive attention in recent years. This work designs and optimizes the low-energy transfer of the heliocentric formation of GW detectors, which starts from a geosynchronous transfer orbit and targets an Earth-like orbit. Based on the example of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), the transfer is first designed in two-body dynamical models and then refined in simplified high-fidelity dynamical models that only consider the major orbital perturbations evaluated here. The main contributions of this work are to present an adaptive model continuation technique and to exploit the lunar swingby technique to reduce the problem-solving difficulty and velocity increment of orbital transfer, respectively. The adaptive model continuation technique fully reveals the effect of perturbations and rapidly iterates the solutions to the simplified models. The simulation results show that the lunar swingby does reduce the energy needed to escape the Earth’s sphere of influence. It is found that the gravitation of the Earth–Moon system has a significant contribution to reducing the velocity increment. The solution of low-energy transfer in the simplified models is that the duration is 360.6615 days and the total velocity increment is 0.8468 km/s.'
