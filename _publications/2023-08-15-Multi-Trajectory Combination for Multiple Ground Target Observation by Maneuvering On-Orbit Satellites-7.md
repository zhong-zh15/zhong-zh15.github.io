excerpt: 'Compared with launching new satellites, it is an economic scheme to use on-orbit satellites to maneuver to meet users' particular needs for Earth observation. This paper studies the mission design method of on-orbit satellite maneuver for observing large-scale ground targets within a given duration. This paper divides the original large-scale sequence optimization problem into two small-scale subproblems that are easy to optimize: short-sequence trajectory generation and multi-trajectory combination optimization. The multi-trajectory combination framework, including database generation, multi-trajectory combination selection, trajectory patching, and trajectory keeping, is adopted to optimize the observation sequence and design the satellite's trajectory. In two specific scenarios, the fuel-optimal scenario and accurate revisit observation scenario, the proposed framework shows competitive optimization performance compared with existing tree search algorithms. In addition, this paper provides a known optimal result for the 11th China Trajectory Optimization Competition problem.'
